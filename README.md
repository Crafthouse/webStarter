# Welcome to webStarter

webStarter is a PHP7 website boilerplate.
An easy way to start a new website project.

How to use:
- Make sure you have MAMP or others set to run PHP7
- Clone or download the project.
- run npm install in your terminal, this will install all node_modules.
- Change the proxy in gulpfile.js. (ex. http://webStarter:8888/).

Gulp tasks:
- type: gulp watch (this will open browser-sync).
- type: gulp deploy (this will create a ready for production version of the website).
